##Project 5

This project took a long time and I took a break over the summer because of a crazy work schedule.  It was very challenging because I am a newbie to js and it seemed like it took me a long time to figure things out.  

I made a map of some of the coffee shops in the Boulder, Colorado area.  I drink a lot of coffee, Boulder is an interesting place and I work in Boulder.  I used a lot of different resources and tried to keep track of everything.  I'm sure that I missed some, but the ones below were very helpful and I wouldn't have been able to do the project without them.  

My second api is Open Weather Map and gives the current temperature in Boulder.  I added this into my project because we had an atypically cool May and June in Colorado and I was monitoring the daily temperature so I could plant flowers and a garden.  There were a lot of other cool things the api could do, but I decided to wait until my skills increase before I attempted to add them to my map.  I hope to rework this project at a later time when I feel more comfortable with everything I learned.
